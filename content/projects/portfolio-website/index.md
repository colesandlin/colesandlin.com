I built this static website with Hugo to act as an online portfolio for all of my projects. I chose Hugo because of its performance and ease of use. I used the [PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) theme as the foundation and customized it to my liking by implementing custom HTML and CSS elements. I opted to use GitHub Pages for hosting because itâ€™s free and seamlessly integrates with Git.
