For my senior design project at the University of Kentucky, I worked with a team of three other students, in collaboration with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, to develop a mobile application to act as a study tool for pharmacy students. Our team chose to use React Native in order to fulfill the client's request for cross-platform compatibility. My contribution was implementing the Cloud Firestore database responsible for storing user-generated content. I chose to use Cloud Firestore because of its real-time capabilities and scalability.
