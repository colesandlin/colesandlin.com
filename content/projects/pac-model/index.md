During my time at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, I collaborated on a tool to model the performance of powdered activated carbon (PAC) treatment in drinking water treatment plants. It helps users evaluate how different properties affect contaminant removal, informing regulatory decision-making processes. I mostly worked on the front-end, which was written in R because of its wide use among researchers.
