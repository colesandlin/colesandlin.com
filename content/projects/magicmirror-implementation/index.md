[MagicMirror²](https://magicmirror.builders/) is an open-source platform which can be used to create a smart mirror. I installed my instance on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and connected it to an LCD display taken from an old Samsung monitor I bought at a yard sale. I applied one-way mirror film to a piece of tempered glass I had custom cut at a local glass shop then placed it in front of the screen to achieve the desired effect. I built the housing for the project out of oak boards.
